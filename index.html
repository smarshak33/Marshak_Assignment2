    <h4> As "City of Yes" policies sweep through New York City, high-rise development in Coney Island is proliferating- set in motion by a 2009 rezoning law's plan to shrink Coney Island's amusement district while expanding residential areas. </h4>

<p>A surge of luxury development in Coney Island since the pandemic is changing the landscape of the neighborhood. </p>

<p>Tax lot data shows that at least 11 high-rise residential apartment buildings have been built in Coney Island in the past 15 years, following the passage of a 2009 rezoning law which shrunk the amusement district, while increasing housing. </p> 

<p>“You don’t just need only low-income housing, you need some affordable, some market-rate. And that’s what’s happening in New York. More and more development,”said Dominic Rekkia, former New York City Council member who was a lobbyist for the rezoning plan.</p>

<p>Before the rezoning law was enacted, only two high-rises (with nine floors or more) were constructed in the area in a 15-year period preceding 2009. </p>

</script>

<p>Charles Denson, executive director of the Coney Island History Project, said that increased development is tied to the Department of City Planning’s “City of Yes” policies that look to expand affordable housing in every neighborhood in the city. </p>

<p>Craig Hammerman, Coney Island expert and resident, said “affordable for who- is the question.”</p>

<p> According to him,  the ups and downs of construction since the rezoning law follow a chronological pattern.  In 2012, Superstorm Sandy devastated the flood prone land, accounting for the dip in new high-rise buildings illustrated in the chart. </p>

<p> He said that the rise of the national economy and building patterns in general explained the uptick in building development from 2015-2020, up until the pandemic. Once the pandemic ended, construction started picking up again in 2022, accounting for some of the trends. </p>
